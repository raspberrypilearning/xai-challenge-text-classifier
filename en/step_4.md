Amazing! Your model is now ready to receive **values**, but it’s missing one important thing - **labels**.

**Labels** are how the model recognises the different **classes** we will use to group our songs: our playlist names from the previous stage. While the model is tracking all the audio features of a song, the user labels that data and places it in a class based on whether they think it belongs there. 

For example, if you’re listening to a song that you define as a `heartbreak` track, you need to take all the information about it (the values) and label that data with `heartbreak`**.** This puts it into the `heartbreak` class. Once the model groups the data in this way, it can analyse it and then make predictions based on it.

![An image explaining that a class is a category that data can be assigned to with a picture of several different apples in a box, alongside an explanation that a label is applied to a single piece of data to indicate which class it belongs to and a single apple](images/class_vs_label.png)

The classes you choose could be for times in your user’s life when they might want specific kinds of music playing, or for specific audio features for the model to prefer or avoid. You could have classes for relaxation, mental focus, or getting physically active just as easily as playlists for quiet, loud or live performances.

**Choose: Pick at least three classes for your model which represent your playlists**

Write them down somewhere - you'll need them later.

As you add them, they will appear as boxes in your model’s training page, ready to receive data. You will need to add the data to these classes in the form of examples of both kinds of quotes
